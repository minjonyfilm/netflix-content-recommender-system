# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Content Recommender System

## Description

This project aims to design an interactive recommendation system for Netflix content, encompassing both movies and TV shows. The project began with meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values across various columns and engineer date-related features. During the exploratory data analysis phase, content types and ratings were visualized to gain insights into the diversity of available content. A key step in feature engineering was the creation of the 'content' feature, aggregating several textual attributes to represent each content item uniquely.

The core of the recommendation system involves transforming this 'content' feature into a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) matrix. Utilizing this matrix, a cosine similarity matrix was computed to capture the likeness between content items, facilitating personalized recommendations based on user preferences or viewing history.

To enhance user engagement and accessibility, the project leveraged Streamlit to develop an interactive web application. This addition allows users to easily select movies or TV shows from a dropdown menu and receive tailored content recommendations, significantly improving the user experience.
